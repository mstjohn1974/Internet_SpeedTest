## Create Python Virtual Environment
After you have cloned this project I recommend that you initialize 
a **Python Virtual Environment**. Use the following command in your project
folder to do so:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
After creating the **Virtual Environment** you need to activate it. Use the following command to do so:

```
. ./.venv/bin/activate
```

Once you are done working with your project it is recommended to deactivate the **Python Virtual Environment**, simply execute the following command:

```
deactivate
```

That's it, enjoy
